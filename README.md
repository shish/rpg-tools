various scripts I've made to help with roleplay game sessions


die
~~~
a simple roller, at the prompt type eg "2d12 d6" to roll those dice;
rolls explode according to the Savage Worlds rules.


die-objects.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I spent an RPG session being mostly incapacitated; since I had
free time, I figured that an excellent idea would be to make a
python library which would allow me to type eg "three.d.six"
and have it return three random numbers between 1 and 6.


stats.py
~~~~~~~~
A quick script to print out the odds of rolling a certain number,
a demonstration that if you need a 6 to pass a test, then rolling
a d4 gives you higher odds of succeeding than rolling a d6 (assuming
that your game system makes a 4 on a d4 explode)
